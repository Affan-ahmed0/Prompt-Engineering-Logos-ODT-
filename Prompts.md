2nd Pass:
Hiii 👋 Imagine you live in 1840's London, working your days as a Liquor Brewer. Now create an image logomark and logotype for a Coffee Brand called "Kettle Works", a industrial era hangout spot for young industry wokers, which offers cheap eats and coffee, proudly sources from the Ethiopian colonies, using inks, red and green (of the cooffee beans). The logo must be printable with a simple die so restrain it to linework.
